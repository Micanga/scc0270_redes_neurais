# SCC0270 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository refers to the USP Neural Networks and Deep Learning module (code: SCC0270). This module aims to present basic concepts of Artificial Neural Networks and the current most important models. To analyze the behavior of these models, their fundamental capabilities and limitations, allowing the use of these techniques to solve practical problems.
